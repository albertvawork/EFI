      <h1>COOKIE POLICY</h1>
      <p>Last updated on (date when the policy was updated on the site)</p>

      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        This policy explains the different cookies used by RK Exercises For
        Injuries Corp (EFI) dba Exercises For Injuries (hereinafter referred to
        as “Exercises For Injuries,” "Company," "Our," "We," or "Us") on our
        website (collectively, “the App/Website” or “our Website”), and how you
        can control them. We may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please
        look at the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page to see when this
        Cookie Policy was last revised. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will
        become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or
        through the Site. Please see our Privacy Notice to understand how we use
        the personal information we collect about you.
      </p>

      <h2>What are cookies:</h2>
      <p>
        A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of data and information
        downloaded to your computer and stored on your computer's hard drive or
        mobile device when visiting a website. Cookies allow a website to
        recognize your device. We place cookies called "first-party cookies,"
        whereas cookies placed by third parties are called "third-party
        cookies," as explained below.
      </p>

      <h2>Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <h3>Web Beacon:</h3>
      <p>
        A Web beacon is an invisible graphic image, such as a pixel tag or
        transparent GIF, placed on a webpage or in an e-mail message to monitor
        user activity, such as whether the webpage or e-mail message is accessed
        or clicked. They are also used on many web pages for alignment purposes.
        Technologies like the above may be used with cookies to track how a
        visitor navigates a website and processes the information on that
        website.
      </p>

      <h2>How does Exercises For Injuries use cookies:</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to make the experience simple and practical when you visit our
        Site. One of the ways we achieve that goal is by placing cookies on your
        device, including desktops and mobile devices, following your
        preferences set through our Cookie Settings options.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you navigate through and interact with our Site, the tracking
        technologies enable the automatic collection of information about your
        equipment, browsing actions and patterns, IP address and browser
        information, and the resources you access and use on the Site. If you
        access our Site via your mobile device, we may collect your unique
        device identifier, mobile device IP address and information about your
        device's operating system. The information we collect informs us about
        ways to improve our website design, functionality, and content to
        deliver better and more personalized content and services, helps us
        estimate our audience size and usage patterns and recognizes you when
        you return to our Site. We also use our cookies for marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of cookies:</h2>
      <h3>Strictly Necessary:</h3>
      <p>
        Some cookies are strictly necessary to make a website usable by enabling
        essential functions such as page navigation and access to secure site
        areas. Strictly necessary cookies are first-party cookies placed by us
        and these are session-based, meaning they expire when you leave our
        website. A Site cannot function properly without these cookies.
      </p>

      <h3>Preference:</h3>
      <p>
        Preference cookies enable a website to remember a visitor's past choices
        when visiting the website, such as a visitor’s preferred language or the
        region from which the website is viewed.
      </p>

      <h3>Marketing:</h3>
      <p>
        Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across websites. These
        cookies help advertisers deliver relevant and engaging content for the
        individual user and limit the number of times a visitor sees a given
        advertisement. These are persistent cookies and are almost always placed
        by third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>Analytics/Statistics:</h3>
      <p>
        Analytics cookies help website owners understand how visitors interact
        with websites. These analytic services enable us to know how many users
        we have, which parts of our website are most popular, what browsers are
        used, the country or region where users are located, and the
        demographics and interests of users.
      </p>

      <h2>First and Third-party cookies:</h2>
      <h3>First-Party Cookies:</h3>
      <p>
        First-party cookies are delivered by, or on behalf of, the company whose
        website you visit. We utilize first-party cookies on our websites.
      </p>

      <h3>Third-Party Cookies that We Use:</h3>
      <p>
        Third-party cookies are those used on our Websites by third parties who
        perform specific tasks for us. These third parties may include our
        advertising partners, analytics providers, payment processing partners,
        and security and fraud detection partners. Below are some of the
        third-party service providers we use on our Websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use AdWords Remarketing through Google, a Remarketing and Behavioral
        Targeting service provided by Google, Inc. that connects the activity on
        our Websites with the AdWords advertising network and the DoubleClick
        cookie, which collects information regarding your browsing history. To
        opt out of this tracking, please see
        <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en"
          >this link</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also participate in all of Google Analytics Advertising. This
        includes (i) Remarketing with Google Analytics, (ii) Google Display
        Network Impression Reporting, (iii) DoubleClick Campaign Manager
        integration, and (iv) Google Analytics Demographics and Interest
        Reporting. Google uses cookies to track activity performed by Google
        Analytics and its AdWords or DoubleClick cookie. To opt out of Google
        Analytics tracking, please download the opt-out add-on
        <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also use Hotjar, which records sessions and website visitors. Hotjar
        uses tracking codes installed in your browser to track your sessions
        with us, and we use these recordings to improve our performance and
        Services to you. Hotjar does not capture sensitive data and often
        complies with applicable privacy laws by anonymizing interactions on our
        Websites. You may opt out of Hotjar session recordings using the Hotjar
        Do Not Track option at
        <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/privacy/do-not-track/">this link</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use AtData’s API (<a href="https://www.atdata.com/"
          >https://www.atdata.com/</a
        >) to optimize the email addresses we collect from users to ensure each
        email is personalized to each subscriber’s preference. AtData may use
        cookies, beacons, and other tracking technologies to determine unique
        individual identifiers for effectively tailoring marketing emails.
        However, like other third parties, AtData only uses the email addresses
        we share with it to help us improve our marketing. It does not use the
        email addresses for anything else. You can review AtData’s privacy
        policy for more about its privacy practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use Data Accelerator (<a href="https://dataaccelerator.ai/"
          >https://dataaccelerator.ai/</a
        >) to optimize the email addresses we collect from users. Data
        Accelerator takes precautions to protect your information both online
        and offline. For any questions about Data Accelerator’s privacy policy,
        you may get in touch with
        <a href="mailto:info@definitiveedgemarketing.com"
          >info@definitiveedgemarketing.com</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Social Media Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Our Websites may include social media features that may collect your IP
        address and the page you are visiting on the applicable Website. They
        may set a cookie to enable the feature to function correctly. Social
        media features are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our
        Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the
        privacy policy of the third-party entity providing them.
      </p>

      <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
      <p>
        We use electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called
        single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags), which allow us to collect
        information about your visit to our Websites, measure and improve the
        effectiveness of advertisements and track the delivery of advertising.
        Web beacons collect only limited information, including a cookie number,
        the time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which
        the web beacon resides. We may also use web beacons in the email
        messages we send you. This allows us to determine if you opened or acted
        on the email messages. Because web beacons are the same as any other
        content request, you cannot opt-out or refuse them without impairing the
        function of these technologies. However, they can be rendered
        ineffective by opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in
        your browser.
      </p>

      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        We may also use JavaScript, a computer language that enhances the
        functionality of websites, particularly with respect to pictures. We use
        JavaScript to analyze and improve our Websites’ functions. You may
        deactivate JavaScript through your browser settings or activate it the
        same way. If you disable JavaScript, you will not be able to use some of
        the functions of our Websites.
      </p>

      <h2>How You Can Manage Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies used on our website can be enabled or disabled through your
        browser. To disable cookies through your browser, follow the
        instructions usually located within the "Help," "Tools", or "Edit" menus
        in your browser. Please note that disabling a cookie or category of
        cookies does not delete the cookie from your browser unless manually
        deleted through your browser function. Disabling cookies may impact your
        ability to use certain features of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to disable a previously placed cookie on your device, we
        will cease collecting any further information from your user experience.
        However, the information collected before the preference change may
        still be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a visitor opts out of tracking for marketing cookies, a new cookie
        is placed on their device to prevent future tracking. If you wish to
        withdraw your previously provided consent for us to use marketing
        cookies, you may contact us via
        <a href="mailto:privacy@ExercisesforInjuries.net"
