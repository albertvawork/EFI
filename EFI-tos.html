        These Terms and Conditions will be governed by the laws of the Province
        of British Columbia, Canada, without regard to its conflict of laws
        principles. Both parties agree to abide by the Arbitration and Actions
        Section mentioned below. They also agree to waive any objections based
        upon venue and submit to the jurisdiction of the Province of British
        Columbia courts. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
        International Sale of Goods does not govern these Terms and Conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>22. Arbitration and Actions</h3>
      <p>
        Unless prohibited by applicable law, any disagreement, claim, or dispute
        arising from or related to these Terms and Conditions, your use of the
        website, or the relationship resulting from these Terms and Conditions
        (including, but not limited to, the execution, breach, enforcement,
        existence, or validity of the matters provided in these Terms and
        Conditions) that both parties (“You” and “Us”) cannot resolve amicably,
        will be resolved through private and confidential binding arbitration in
        Kelowna, British Columbia. The arbitration will be conducted in English
        and governed by British Columbia law under the Arbitration Act, 1991
        (British Columbia) or its amendments. A single arbitrator will preside
        over the arbitration to the exclusion of the courts. The arbitrator must
        be an independent legal professional with experience in the Canadian
        information technology industry. You agree that you will resolve any
        claim that you may have against us through an individual arbitration
        process. This preceding statement means that you cannot combine your
        claim with any claim, controversy, or dispute that any other party may
        have. You agree to give up any right you may have to start or
        participate in a class action lawsuit against us regarding any such
        claim. Also, where applicable, you agree to opt out of any class
        proceedings against us. Notwithstanding the preceding, we reserve the
        right to pursue the protection of intellectual property rights and
        confidential information through injunctive or other equitable relief
        through the courts.

        any disputes with us individually. You cannot bring a claim against us
        as part of a class arbitration, class action, private attorney general
        action, or consolidation with other arbitrations. This condition is
        necessary for all users to use our website or services. You, as a result
        of this, consent to this condition.
      </p>

      <h3>24. Waiver of Jury Trial</h3>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, you are
        waiving your right to a trial by jury for any claims or issues that
        arise with these Terms of Service, including any breaches or fraudulent
        inducement claims. This waiver applies to both contract and tort claims.
        You acknowledge that if any of the provisions of this paragraph are
        currently unenforceable under applicable law, both parties intend for
        this paragraph to apply in the event such provisions later become
        enforceable under such law. This provision will remain in full force and
        effect regardless of any termination of your use of our website.

        control, including without limitation an act of war or terrorism,
        natural disaster, failure of electricity supply, riot, civil disorder,
        or civil commotion or other event of force majeure.

      <p>
        No Agency or Partnership Relationship: The operation of the agreement
        does not create any agency or partnership relationship.
